Specifically: spell the double-voweled sounds.

It's 2020, the world is suffering from a global pandemic. My daughter Nora, 5 years old, has taken to learning to read and write.

She's having a little trouble with the double-voweled sounds in Dutch, "oe", "au", "ie", "eu", et cetera.  
But she loves to practice her writing and is asking us all day long: "Hoe schrijf je de 'oe'?", "Hoe schrijf je de 'eu'?"     

This little web-app is made for her, to be able to ask the computer these questions and hopefully get a quick answer.

Also, it allowed me to play with Javascript Speech API, which is super fun.

Note: very rough around the edges: speech recognition is not that easy, who'da thunk it?     
Only works in Chrome due to SpeechRecognition support, and maybe Firefox Nightly.
